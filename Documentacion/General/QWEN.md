# RECOOM POS - Sistema de Punto de Venta para Abarrotes Multi-Sucursal

## 📋 Project Overview

RECOOM POS is a specialized Point of Sale (POS) application designed for grocery stores (abarrotes) with a distributed inventory model. The system supports multiple locations: Central Warehouse, Store 1, and Store 2. It's built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) to function in environments with variable connectivity, allowing complete offline operation.

### Key Technologies

- **Frontend**: React (SPA) with Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with dark mode support
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with local IndexedDB storage
- **Offline Storage**: IndexedDB for offline functionality
- **Deployment**: PWA (Progressive Web App)

### Core Features

- **PWA Capabilities**: Installable, offline operation, automatic synchronization
- **POS Interface**: Quick sales interface with product search and barcode scanning
- **Distributed Inventory**: Stock control by location with alerts for low stock
- **Inter-store Transfers**: Request, approval, and tracking of transfers
- **Role-based Access**: Different permissions for Cashier, Manager, and Administrator
- **Reporting**: Sales reports, profit analysis, and inventory movements
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- **Employee Consumption Tracking**: For tracking items consumed by employees
- **Shopping List Management**: Feature for creating purchase requests and generating expenses

## 🔧 Building and Running

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- npm 7+

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Development Commands

- Start development server: `npm run dev`
- Build for production: `npm run build`
- Preview production build: `npm run preview`
- Build PWA: `npm run build-pwa`
- Lint code: `npm run lint`
- Run tests: `npm run test` or `npm run test:run`
- Run e2e tests: `npm run test:e2e`
- Setup database: `npm run setup-db`
- Validate database: `npm run validate-db`

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file with your Supabase credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
```

### Database Schema

The application uses Supabase with PostgreSQL and includes these main tables:

- `products` - Product information and pricing
- `categories` - Product categories and subcategories
- `users` - User accounts with roles and store assignments
- `stores` - Store locations
- `inventory_batches` - Inventory by location with expiration tracking
- `sales` - Transaction records with payment details
- `clients` - Customer information
- `transfers` - Inter-store transfer requests
- `shopping_list` - Purchase requests
- `expenses` - Expense tracking
- `cash_closings` - Cash register closing records

## 📱 Offline Functionality

### Local Data Storage

- Product catalog
- Categories and subcategories
- User information and assigned stores
- Inventory batches
- Recent sales (last 100)
- Clients and suppliers

### Offline Operations

- Product search and selection
- Sale processing
- Cart management
- Discount application
- Sale note recording

### Automatic Synchronization

- Syncs pending transactions when connection is restored
- Updates local data with server information
- Ensures data consistency

## 🎨 Development Conventions

### Styling

- Uses Tailwind CSS with a custom dark-themed design system
- Responsive design with breakpoints for xs, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl
- Consistent color palette with primary, surface, and accent colors
- Dark mode support using 'class' strategy

### Code Quality

- ESLint for code linting with React plugin
- Prettier-style formatting (implied from configuration)
- Modern JavaScript/ES6+ syntax
- React hooks for state and side effects
- Zustand for global state management
- Vitest and React Testing Library for testing

### PWA Implementation

- Service worker for offline functionality
- Web app manifest for installability
- Network status detection
- Automatic synchronization when online

## 🚀 Deployment

### PWA Deployment

Use the `npm run build-pwa` command to create a production build with all necessary PWA assets (manifest, service worker, icons).

### Supabase Backend

The application is configured to work with Supabase as the primary backend, with automatic migration scripts provided for setting up the required database schema.

## 🛡️ Security

- User authentication with role-based permissions
- Route protection based on user permissions
- Input validation on the client and server side
- Secure credential management through environment variables

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes a testing system based on Vitest and React Testing Library:

- Unit tests for UI components
- Integration tests
- Component rendering tests
- State management tests with Zustand

Execute tests:

```bash
npm run test:run  # Run tests once
npm run test      # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:e2e  # Run end-to-end tests
```
