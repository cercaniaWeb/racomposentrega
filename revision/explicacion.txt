  I have created a complete database configuration management system for the POS application that includes:

   1. Interactive Setup Script (scripts/setup-db-config.js):
      - Allows users to easily configure their Supabase credentials
      - Validates inputs to ensure they're properly formatted
      - Creates or updates the .env file with the database configuration
      - Provides clear instructions during the setup process

   2. Validation Script:
      - Added as a validate-db command in package.json
      - Checks if the current database configuration is valid
      - Helps troubleshoot configuration issues

   3. Shell Script Alternative (scripts/setup-db-env.sh):
      - A bash script alternative for environments that prefer shell scripts
      - Supports both interactive and parameterized usage
      - Provides validation for input values

   4. Documentation:
      - Created comprehensive documentation about the database setup process
      - Added usage instructions to the main README
      - Included a guide explaining how the system works

   5. Package.json Integration:
      - Added setup-db and validate-db commands to package.json
      - Easy-to-remember npm scripts for configuration management

  The solution makes it much easier for developers to configure the database connection without manually editing environment files or worrying about the correct format of
  the credentials. The system validates inputs to prevent common errors and provides clear feedback throughout the process.

  This addresses the user's request to create a script to manage database configuration for both the app and server (in this case, the Supabase backend) to simplify the
  setup process.
